Jeremy Kay Intro
============

This is a little bio/intro about myself that I worked up using [impress.js](https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js)

Hopefully it gives you a sense of who I am as a developer, and is a bit more fun to read than your standard resume (although I have a PDF of that at the end if you want it).
